## Profession & Current Role
I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** specializing in **Laravel, Filament, and AI-driven systems**.  
My work centers on **solutions architecture, technical leadership, and enterprise-scale automation**, helping teams bridge platforms, APIs, and data systems into coherent, resilient solutions.

## Top Skills & Technologies
- **Languages & Frameworks**: PHP 8.x, Laravel (5–12), Livewire, FilamentPHP, Vue/Alpine  
- **System Design**: SaaS architecture, event-driven design, API-first platforms, enterprise integrations (Salesforce, Oracle Fusion, Snowflake)  
- **Data & AI**: Postgres/MySQL, vector search, embeddings, AI orchestration (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Openrouter)  
- **DevOps & Tools**: NativePHP, Valet, Docker, Git, Pusher/Echo/Reverb  

## Featured Projects

### Work
- **Enterprise Integrations** – Automated Oracle Fusion Service Request workflows, including attachment extraction, storage pipelines, and audit logging.  
- **Data Orchestration** – Designed sync engines across Salesforce, Snowflake, and custom apps for reporting, analytics, and automation.  
- **Technical Leadership** – Advocated for and established **Staff Engineer / Solutions Architect roles**, shaping cross-team technical strategy.  

### Personal
- **[Fragments Engine](https://fragmentsengine.com)** – A Laravel + Livewire knowledge engine for **atomic note-taking, AI enrichment, and agent orchestration**.  
- **CSTL (Character Sheet Template Language)** – An open JSON-based standard for representing RPG character sheets, rules, and layouts, with Filament CRUD and dictionary support.  
- **LnkLst** – A modern bookmarking and link-sharing platform that blends **AI tagging, auto-ranking, RSS feeds, APIs, and Chrome extensions**. A cross between Readwise, link sharing, and tab management. Users can publish curated lists (e.g. *Laravel Starter Kits* or *My Social Links*) with velocity-based ranking signals from the web.  

## Bio
I build **systems that eliminate complexity**: focusing on small, composable units that scale into engines, workflows, and stories.  

My path has spanned from **founding early online communities for writers** to **pioneering voice chat on Facebook’s first APIs**, to today’s **AI-augmented engines for productivity and creativity**.

## Previous Accomplishments
- Founded **Lit.Org** and **WritingForums.com**, some of the internet’s earliest writing communities (still serving as technical advisor at WritingForums).  
- Built **Talkr**, the first ever voice chat app for Facebook, enabling 20,000 users to chat live during baseball games with streaming + Asterisk integration.  
- Authored **Spam Guardian** for Nucleus CMS, blocking 99% of comment spam when it launched.  
- Co-founded **451 Press**, a blog network spanning 500+ sites and writers.  
- Documentation for a custom project directly contributed to a client’s successful defense in a **$7.5M lawsuit**.

## Fun Facts & Hobbies
- Writing speculative sci-fi (**Rendered State Cosmology**, *Liminal Space Saga*) and urban fantasy (*The Saint of Broken Things*).  
- Designing tabletop RPG systems (CSTL grew from this).  
- Running experimental projects with goats and cats as mascots.  
- Still nostalgic for old-school BBS era ANSI art, UI/UX, and Interface designs.
